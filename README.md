# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

The prework study guide website was a way for students to practice building a website while learning how to use Git via GitHub and GitBash, vscode, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has useful notes for working with the previous languages/programs. I have learned the Git workflow, how to implement version control, how to structure and style a website and how to use conditional logic via JavaScript to make the website more interactive.
